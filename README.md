# hector
Hector is a **basic** and **uncomplete** language that aims to make common operations within a ray tracer easier to write.

#hectorc
Hectorc is a compiler that was created for **experimenting and training purposes**. It uses Lex and Yacc to create an AST, produces C source code and outputs an executable.

#Instructions for Mac OSX
1. Run `./build.sh` to build the compiler.
2. Run `./hectorc -d valgrind.hc` to compile the default test file.
3. Run `./valgrind` to execute the program.

#Disclaimer
I do not intend to make this README more comprehensive for the time being. If you are reading this, then I suppose you are able to figure out most of this stuff on your own. If not, then feel free to contact me.
